## Introduction

The ChatGPT Clone project aims to replicate the functionality of a chatbot using a simplified model of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 architecture. This version is optimized for desktop screens and provides an interface through which users can engage in text-based conversations with the chatbot.

## Features

- 💬 Text-based conversation with a simulated chatbot.
- 🖥️ Simple and intuitive desktop interface.
- ⚡ Real-time message generation and display.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need:

- 🌐 A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
- 💻 A code editor for making customizations (Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc.).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatgpt-clone.git
Navigate to the project directory.
bash
Copy code
cd chatgpt-clone
Open the chatGPT-clone.html file in your preferred web browser to see the chatbot interface.
Usage
Upon opening the index.html file in your browser, you'll be greeted with the chatbot interface. You can start a conversation by typing in the message input field at the bottom of the screen and pressing "Enter" or clicking the "Send" button.
